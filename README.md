# rPi_LCD_btcDisplay
<h1>Raspberry Pi LCD (the Adafruit RGB Negative 16x2 LCD+Keypad Kit) to display information on bitcoin addresses </h1>

<h2>Motivation:</h2>  
The question of how to have an IoT like device display information on one's cold wallet came up in a recent forum posting.  I had a raspberry pi model B that was used initially for bitcoin mining (http://www.instructables.com/id/Bitcoin-Mining-using-Raspberry-Pi/), and having long since stopped realized that I could still use the components for this idea.

<h2>Goal</h2>
Have a rPi with a LCD screen display information pertaining to bitcoin addresses of interest.
